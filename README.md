[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spree-contrib/spree_braintree_vzero.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spree-contrib/spree_braintree_vzero) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/repos/560308aa6956801375000a4e/badges/9874199a656054d613cd/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/repos/560308aa6956801375000a4e/feed)

This is the official Braintree v.zero extension for [Spree](https://spreecommerce.org). It supports:
* [Braintree Hosted Fields](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_braintree_vzero/wiki/1.-Hosted-Fields) -  style the credit card form to match your UI with full PCI compliance
* [PayPal Express Checkout](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_braintree_vzero/wiki/2.-PayPal-Express) - the fastest way for buyers to pay with PayPal - available on Spree for the first time
* [Braintree Drop-in UI](http://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_braintree_vzero/wiki/3.-Drop-in-UI) - start accepting payments ASAP

Behind-the-scenes, this extension uses [Braintree Ruby SDK](https://github.com/braintree/braintree_ruby).


## Installation

1. Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:

    #### Spree >= 3.1

    ```ruby
    gem 'spree_braintree_vzero', '~> 3.5'
    ```

    #### Spree 3.0 and Spree 2.x

    ```ruby
    gem 'spree_braintree_vzero', github: 'spree-contrib/spree_braintree_vzero', branch: 'X-X-stable'
    ```

    The `branch` option is important: it must match the version of Spree you're using.
    For example, use `3-0-stable` if you're using Spree `3-0-stable` or any `3.0.x` version.

2. Install the gem using Bundler:
    ```ruby
    bundle install
    ```

3. Copy & run migrations
    ```ruby
    bundle exec rails g spree_braintree_vzero:install
    ```

4. Restart your server

    If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.

## Documentation

See [wiki](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_braintree_vzero/wiki) for more detailed documentation.

## Heroku installation (optional)

Additional to migrations the gem adds a cron task (via the [Whenever gem](https://github.com/javan/whenever)) which is needed for updating transaction states from _submited for settlement_ to _settled_ ([Braintree v.zero transaction states](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/transactions/ruby#status)). To run on Heroku you have to add a task to [Heroku Scheduler](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler):

```
rake spree_braintree_vzero:update_states
```

Recommended frequency is every 6 hours.
